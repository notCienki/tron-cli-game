# 🏍️ Tron CLI Game

A terminal-based Tron light cycle game built with C++ and ncurses.

## 🎯 About

This project was born out of pure boredom during university lectures 😄. Instead of scrolling through social media, I decided to build something fun while practicing my C++ skills!

Classic Tron gameplay: control your light cycle, avoid crashing into walls and trails, make your opponents crash first.

## 🚀 Features

- Terminal-based gameplay with ASCII graphics
- Real-time arrow key controls
- Collision detection
- Clean, modular C++ code structure

## 🛠️ Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install ncurses

# Linux
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```

**Build & Run:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tron-cli.git
cd tron-cli
